At the age of eleven, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid informs him that he is actually a wizard and that his parents were murdered by an evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Voldemort also attempted to kill one-year-old Harry on the same night, but his killing curse mysteriously rebounded and reduced him to a weak and helpless form. Harry became extremely famous in the Wizarding World as a result. Harry begins his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and learns about magic. During the year, Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger become entangled in the mystery of the Philosopher\\'s Stone which is being kept within the school.\\n\\n\\n=== Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) ===\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione return to Hogwarts for their second year, which proves to be more challenging than the last. The Chamber of Secrets has been opened, leaving students and ghosts petrified by an unleashed monster. Harry must face up to claims that he is the heir of Salazar Slytherin (founder of the Chamber), learn that he can speak Parseltongue, and also discover the properties of a mysterious diary, only to find himself trapped within the Chamber itself.\\n\\n\\n=== Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) ===\\n\\nHarry\\'s third year sees the boy wizard, along with his friends, attending Hogwarts School once again. Professor R. J. Lupin joins the staff as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, while convicted murderer Sirius Black escapes from Azkaban. The Ministry of Magic entrusts the Dementors to guard Hogwarts from Black. Harry learns more about his past and his connection with the escaped prisoner.\\n\\n\\n=== Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) ===\\n\\nDuring Harry\\'s fourth year, Hogwarts plays host to the Triwizard Tournament. Three European schools participate in the tournament, with three \\'champions\\' representing each school in the deadly tasks. The Goblet of Fire chooses Fleur Delacour, Viktor Krum, and Cedric Diggory to compete against each other. However, Harry\\'s name is also produced from the Goblet thus making him a fourth champion, which leads to a terrifying encounter with a reborn Lord Voldemort.\\n\\n\\n=== Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) ===\\n\\nHarry\\'s fifth year begins with him being attacked by Dementors in Little Whinging. Later, he finds out that the Ministry of Magic is in denial of Lord Voldemort\\'s return. Harry is also beset by disturbing and realistic nightmares, while Professor Umbridge, a representative of Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Harry becomes aware that Voldemort is after a prophecy which reveals: \"neither can live while the other survives\". The rebellion involving the students of Hogwarts, secret organisation Order of the Phoenix, the Ministry of Magic, and the Death Eaters begins.\\n\\n\\n=== Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009) ===\\n\\nIn Harry\\'s sixth year at Hogwarts, Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters are increasing their terror upon the Wizarding and Muggle worlds. Headmaster Albus Dumbledore persuades his old friend Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts as a professor as there is a vacancy to fill. There is a more important reason, however, for Slughorn\\'s return. While in a Potions lesson, Harry takes possession of a strangely annotated school textbook, inscribed as belonging to the \\'Half-Blood Prince\\'. Draco Malfoy struggles to carry out a mission presented to him by Voldemort. Meanwhile, Dumbledore and Harry secretly work together to discover how to destroy the Dark Lord once and for all.\\n\\n\\n=== Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 (2010) ===\\n\\nAfter unexpected events at the end of the previous year, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are entrusted with a quest to find and destroy Lord Voldemort\\'s secret to immortality – the Horcruxes.

K. Rowling. The series was produced and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures and consists of eight fantasy films, beginning with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) and culminating with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011). A spin-off prequel series started with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016), marking the beginning of the Wizarding World shared media franchise.\\nAn American and British co-production, the series was mainly produced by David Heyman, and stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson as the three leading characters: Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger, respectively. Four directors worked on the series: Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuarón, Mike Newell, and David Yates. Michael Goldenberg wrote the screenplay for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007), while the remaining films' screenplays were written by Steve Kloves. Production took place over ten years, with the main story arc following Harry's quest to overcome his arch-enemy Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes).\\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final novel in the series, was adapted into two feature-length parts. Part 1 was released in November 2010, and Part 2 was released in July 2011.\\nDeathly Hallows – Part 2 is among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time—at 20th-highest, grossing $1.3 billion.

The Dark Lord discovers Harry\\'s hunt for his Horcruxes and launches an attack on Hogwarts, where the trio return for one last stand against the dark forces that threaten both the Wizarding and Muggle worlds.\\n\\n\\n=== Future ===\\nIn July 2016, Warner Bros. Entertainment applied to purchase the rights to the stage play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, leading to speculation that it was going to become a film, despite earlier claims, most notably from Rowling, that a film adaptation was not being made.\\nIn November 2021, Chris Columbus, who previously directed the first two installments of the film series, expressed interest in directing a film adaptation of The Cursed Child, with the intent of having the main cast members reprise their roles. When The New York Times asked Daniel Radcliffe in 2022 if he would be ready to reprise his role as Harry Potter, he replied that he was not interested in it at the moment, but did not deny the possibility of returning sometime in the future.\\nIn a Sunday Times interview in August 2025, Columbus confirmed that he maintains close relationships with the original cast but has not spoken to Rowling in \"a decade or so\".  He went on to state that Rowling\\'s anti-trans views mean that a movie version of The Cursed Child with the original cast is \"never going to happen\". In a recent interview with Variety, Columbus spoke of \"separating the artist from the art\" and described the controversy around Rowling as \"just sad, it\\'s very sad\", while noting that he does not agree with her views.' score=0.8175774812698364>, <Record text='=== Scripts ===\\n\\nSteve Kloves wrote the screenplays for all but the fifth film, which was penned by Michael Goldenberg. Kloves had direct assistance from J.K. Rowling, though she allowed him what he described as \"tremendous elbow room\". Rowling asked Kloves to remain faithful to the spirit of the books; thus, the plot and tone of each film and its corresponding book are virtually the same, albeit with some changes and omissions for purposes of cinematic style, time, and budget constraints. Goldenberg also received input from Rowling during his adaptation of the fifth novel; Goldenberg was originally considered to adapt the first novel before the studio chose Kloves.\\nIn a 2010 interview, Heyman briefly explained the book-to-film transition. He commented on Rowling\\'s involvement in the series, stating that she understood that \"books and films are different\" and was \"the best support\" a producer could have. Rowling had overall approval on the scripts, which were viewed and discussed by the director and the producers. Heyman also said that Kloves was the \"key voice\" in the process of adapting the novels and that certain aspects from the books needed to have been excluded from the scripts due to the filmmakers\\' decision to keep the main focus on Harry\\'s journey as a character, which would ultimately give the films a defined structure. Heyman mentioned that some fans \"don\\'t necessarily understand the adaptation process\" and that the filmmakers would have loved to \"have everything\" from the books in the films but noted that it was not possible since they had \"neither time nor cinematic structure\" to do so. He finished by saying that adapting a novel to the screen is \"a really considered process\".\\nBecause the films were being made as the novels were being published, the filmmakers had no idea of the story\\'s outcome until the release of the final novel in 2007. Kloves spoke of his relationship with Rowling when adapting the novels by saying, \"The thing is about Jo, which is remarkable for someone who had no experience with the filmmaking process, was her intuition. We had a conversation the very first day I met her where she said, \\'I know the movies can\\'t be the books ... because I know what\\'s coming and it\\'s impossible to fully dramatise on screen what I\\'m going to write. But I just ask you to be true to the characters; that\\'s all I care about.\\'\" Kloves also said, \"I don\\'t know what compelled me to say this [to Rowling], but I said, \\'I\\'ve just got to warn you my favourite character is not Harry. My favourite character is Hermione.\\' And I think for some weird reason, from that moment on, she sort of trusted me.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Cast and crew ===\\n\\nAside from the three lead actors, other notable cast members include Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, and Dame Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall. Richard Harris, who played the role of Professor Albus Dumbledore, died on 25 October 2002, causing the role to be re-cast to Michael Gambon for Prisoner of Azkaban. Heyman and Cuarón chose Gambon to portray Dumbledore, which he did for all succeeding films. Notable recurring cast members include Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, Warwick Davis as Filius Flitwick, Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, Brendan Gleeson as Alastor Moody, Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley, Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy, Harry Melling as Dudley Dursley, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, Fiona Shaw as Petunia Dursley, Timothy Spall as Peter Pettigrew, David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, Emma Thompson as Sybill Trelawney, Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, and Julie Walters as Molly Weasley.\\nThe series has seen many returning crew members from various departments, including Tim Burke, visual effects supervisor; Peter Doyle, digital film colourist; Nick Dudman, make-up and creature effects designer; David Holmes, stunt double; Amanda Knight, make-up artist; Stephenie McMillan, set designer; Greg Powell, stunt coordinator; Jany Temime, costume designer; and Fiona Weir, casting director.' score=0.8149120807647705>, <Record text='== Origins ==\\nIn late 1997, film producer David Heyman\\'s London offices received a copy of the first book in what would become J.K. Rowling\\'s series of seven Harry Potter novels. The book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher\\'s Stone, was relegated to a low-priority bookshelf, where it was discovered by a secretary who read it and gave it to Heyman with a positive review. Consequently, Heyman, who had originally disliked \"the rubbish title\", read the book himself. Highly impressed by Rowling\\'s work, he began the process that led to one of the most successful cinematic franchises of all time.\\nHeyman\\'s enthusiasm led to Rowling\\'s 1999 sale of the film rights for the first four Harry Potter books to Warner Bros. Pictures for a reported £1 million. A demand Rowling made was that the principal cast be kept strictly British and Irish wherever possible, such as Richard Harris as Dumbledore, allowing nonetheless for casting of French and Eastern European actors in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire where characters from the book are specified as such. Rowling was hesitant to sell the rights because she \"didn\\'t want to give them control over the rest of the story\" by selling the rights to the characters, which would have enabled Warner Bros. to make non-author-written sequels.\\nAlthough Steven Spielberg initially negotiated to direct the first film, the deal was not finalized. Spielberg wanted to combine the story of the novels and make an animated film with his DreamWorks Animation studio, but Warner Bros. was against both ideas, wanting to produce individual live-action films for each novel. In the \"Rubbish Bin\" section of her website, Rowling wrote that she had no role in choosing directors for the films, affirming, \"Anyone who thinks I could (or would) have \\'veto-ed\\' him [Spielberg] needs their Quick-Quotes Quill serviced.\"\\nAfter Spielberg left, conversations began with other directors, including Chris Columbus, Jonathan Demme, Terry Gilliam, Mike Newell, Alan Parker, Wolfgang Petersen, Rob Reiner, Tim Robbins, Brad Silberling, and Peter Weir. Petersen and Reiner both pulled out of the running in March 2000. It was then narrowed down to Columbus, Gilliam, Parker, and Silberling. Rowling\\'s first choice was Gilliam. However, on 28 March 2000, Columbus was appointed as director of the film, with Warner Bros. citing his work on other family films such as Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire as influences for their decision.\\n\\nHarry Potter is the kind of timeless literary achievement that comes around once in a lifetime. Since the books have generated such a passionate following across the world, it was important to us to find a director that has an affinity for both children and magic. I can\\'t think of anyone more ideally suited for this job than Chris [Columbus].\\nSteve Kloves was selected to write the screenplay for the first film. He described adapting the book as \"tough\" since it did not \"lend itself to adaptation as well as the next two books\". Kloves was sent a \"raft\" of synopses of books proposed as film adaptations, with Harry Potter being the only one that jumped out at him. He went out and bought the book, becoming an instant fan. When speaking to Warner Bros. he stated that the film had to be British and true to the characters. David Heyman was confirmed to produce the film. Rowling received a large amount of creative control for the film, an arrangement that Columbus did not mind.\\nWarner Bros. had initially planned to release the first film over the 4 July 2001 weekend, making for such a short production window that several of the originally proposed directors had withdrawn themselves from contention. Eventually, due to time constraints, the date was put back to 16 November 2001.' score=0.8104718923568726>], summary=<neo4j._work.summary.ResultSummary object at 0x00000207F95EAB10>, keys=['text', 'score'])"
